FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

# Alpha Version of stal/IX: The Future of Linux is Here

**stal/IX**, the new statically linked, source-based, bootstrapped rolling Linux operating system, is pleased to announce the release of its alpha version. Based on the popular **IX** package manager, **stal/IX** offers a cutting-edge file system layout inspired by Nix which provides users with a modern, streamlined, and efficient experience.

**stal/IX** is a completely new take on Linux, offering an innovative approach to package management and distribution. Unlike traditional Linux distributions that rely on dynamic linking and shared libraries, **stal/IX** is statically linked, meaning that it includes all of the libraries needed to run the operating system and its applications. This approach provides numerous benefits, including increased security, better performance, and simpler management.

**stal/IX** also features a source-based build system, which allows users to compile their packages from source code, providing them with complete control over their system. This approach also ensures that packages are optimized for the user's specific hardware, resulting in faster and more efficient performance.

One of the most exciting features of **stal/IX** is its bootstrapped rolling release model. This means that the operating system is constantly updated with the latest software, without the need for major version upgrades. This ensures that users always have access to the latest features and security updates.

In addition, **stal/IX** features a file system layout inspired by Nix, which allows for efficient management of packages and dependencies. The file system is organized in a way that allows for easy rollback to previous versions, making it an ideal platform for development and experimentation.

"We're thrilled to release the alpha version of stal/IX," said the **stal/IX** development team. "We believe that our innovative approach to package management and distribution will provide users with a faster, more secure, and more efficient Linux experience."

The alpha version of **stal/IX** is available for download now. For more information, please visit the **stal/IX** website at ~~https://stalix.org/~~ [https://stal-ix.github.io](https://stal-ix.github.io).
