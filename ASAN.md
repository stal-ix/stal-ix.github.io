# AddressSanitizer support in IX

> Prerequisites:<br>
> [IX.md](IX.md)<br>

**IX** can build C/C++ binaries with [AddressSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) to detect and debug memory
safety errors. This feature is considered experimental because statically linked binaries are [not](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html#limitations)
officially supported by AddressSanitizer.

Note: AddressSanitizer integration in **IX** only works for `lib/musl`. Alternative C libraries are currently not supported.

## Basic usage

1. Specify the `--sanitize=address` flag when building the binary package.
2. (optional, but highly recommended) Set the `ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH` environment variable to the path to the `llvm-symbolizer` binary that is built along with `clang` as part of **IX** bootstrapping: `export ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=$(find /ix/store -name llvm-symbolizer | head -n1)`.

For example, let's reproduce [this issue](https://github.com/gavinhoward/bc/commit/8303d0bcc6a78d0e55bf365366761040ed0a17b8)
in `bin/bc/gavin`. At the time of writing, this issue hasn't yet been patched in the latest publically available release.

Without AddressSanitizer, the sequence of commands described in the issue leads to an unhelpful segfault:
```
> ix run bin/bc/gavin -- dc
TOUCH /ix/store/mgSvhXAoiKDgnCi5lw89X1-rlm-ephemeral/touch
*

Runtime error: stack has too few elements
    0: (main)

f
zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./ix run bin/bc/gavin -- dc
```

With AddressSanitizer, we can immediately see where the crash comes from:
```
> export ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=$(find /ix/store -name llvm-symbolizer | head -n1)
> ix run bin/bc/gavin --sanitize=address -- dc
TOUCH /ix/store/LEoZmBPsRU2IvVMcaDn555-rlm-ephemeral/touch
*

Runtime error: stack has too few elements
    0: (main)

## More examples

_Warning: these examples are for illustrative purposes only. Do not use AddressSanitizer as a hardening tool. Quoting the official documentation:_
> While it may be useful for testing, AddressSanitizerâ€™s runtime was not developed with security-sensitive constraints in mind and may compromise the security of the resulting executable.

Let's look at some of the known memory-safety-related vulnerabilities in programs packaged in **IX**, and try to trigger them with AddressSanitizer enabled.
All of these examples were ran with setting `ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH` as described above.

### CVE-2025-26519

`lib/musl` has an unpatched (at the time of writing) buffer overflow in `iconv()` when converting from `EUC-KR` to `UTF-8`. We will create a dummy package with a simple program
that intentionally triggers the overflow by crafting a malicious input of specified size:
```cpp
> cat pkgs/bin/CVE-2025-26519/m.cpp
#include <iconv.h>

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
        if (argc != 2) {
                std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <N>" << std::endl;
                return 1;
        }

        size_t n = std::stoll(argv[1]);
        iconv_t cd = iconv_open("UTF-8", "EUC-KR");
        std::cout << "Processing input of size " << n << std::endl;

        std::vector<char> in(n);
        size_t ii = 0;
        for (ii = 0; ii + 1 < n; ++ii) {
                in[ii] = ii % 2 == 0 ? 0xc8 : 0x41;
        }
        in[ii] = 0x42;
        size_t inb = in.size();
        char* pin = in.data();

        std::vector<char> out(4 * in.size());
        size_t outb = out.size();
        char* pout = out.data();

        size_t res = iconv(cd, &pin, &inb, &pout, &outb);
        std::cout << "Converted " << res << " characters" << std::endl;

        iconv_close(cd);
}
```
```

Without AddressSanitizer, the overflow either goes completely undetected, or leads to a segfault:
```
> ix run bin/CVE-2025-26519 -- CVE-2025-26519 69
TOUCH /ix/store/YD7dWQtGDJz6UcAelY2V50-rlm-ephemeral/touch

Processing input of size 313371
zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./ix run bin/CVE-2025-26519 -- CVE-2025-26519 313371
```

With AddressSanitizer, we get a report about overflowing the heap, including the location of the problematic memory access:
```
> ix run bin/CVE-2025-26519 --sanitize=address -- CVE-2025-26519 69

Note something very interesting: the report says the `WRITE` happened _inside_ `lib/musl` (namely, in [this](https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/multibyte/wcrtomb.c#n6) function).
**IX** makes this possible by using static linking and instrumenting everything compiled into the final binary, including the C library.
When using AddressSanitizer outside of **IX**, the C library is typically linked dynamically and is not instrumented.

### CVE-2025-2574

`bin/xpdf` is a PDF renderer written in C++ that is notorious for [multiple unpatched vulnerabilities](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/5f4f306bea96741f1588ea4f450b2a2e29f42b98/pkgs/applications/misc/xpdf/default.nix#L96-L105).

Let's trigger [one of them](https://www.xpdfreader.com/security-bug/CVE-2025-2574.html): a [stack overflow](https://github.com/karelbilek/xpdf-mirror/blob/2009ee360556e8260a2d8b21820bb8f36c9377e8/xpdf/Function.cc#L1229)
when executing a PostScript function.

To run `bin/xpdf` with AddressSanitizer, we currently have to apply workarounds for two known issues related to AddressSanitizer
integration in **IX**, both of which will eventually be fixed.

First, the following patch should be applied to the IX package base:
```
> git diff
diff --git a/pkgs/bin/xpdf/viewer/ix.sh b/pkgs/bin/xpdf/viewer/ix.sh
index 3cec77d0e..913284aab 100644
--- a/pkgs/bin/xpdf/viewer/ix.sh
+++ b/pkgs/bin/xpdf/viewer/ix.sh
@@ -3,7 +3,6 @@
 {% block bld_libs %}
 lib/qt/6/base
 lib/qt/6/deps
-lib/{{allocator}}/trim(delay=1,bytes=1000000)
 {{super()}}
 {% endblock %}
```

Second, we need to set the `ASAN_OPTIONS` environment variable to `detect_odr_violation=0`.

With that out of the way, let's craft a malicious PDF:
```
> cat xpdf_CVE-2025-2574.pdf
%PDF-1.4
1 0 obj
<< /Type /Catalog /Pages 2 0 R >>
endobj
2 0 obj

   /Resources <<

endobj
4 0 obj
<< /ShadingType 1 /Function 6 0 R >>
endobj

   /Length 33 >>
stream
{ 2147483647 1 roll }
endstream
endobj
trailer
<< /Size 7 /Root 1 0 R >>
%%EOF
```

And try to open it with `bin/xpdf` to get a nice crash report:

Note that `bin/xpdf` is an application that depends on complex libraries such as FreeType, Qt, and Mesa.
We didn't have to care about any of that: everything was statically linked and instrumented, so
if the vulnerability was in any of the dependencies, AddressSanitizer would also catch it.

## Implementation details

### Interceptors

The AddressSanitizer runtime provides dozens of [interceptors](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-01-08-all-about-sanitizer-interceptors),
which override selected functions from the standard C/C++ libraries. An interceptor can either:
  1. Completely override a standard function (e.g., `malloc()`).
  2. Resolve a standard function at runtime using `dlsym()` (e.g, `strcpy()`) and call it.

Since **IX** intentionally doesn't support dynamic linking, interceptors of the second type are modified to directly call the standard
function prefixed with `__real_` (e.g., `__real_strcpy()` instead of `strcpy()`). The library containing the `strcpy()` implementation
(i.e., `lib/musl`) is postprocessed after the build so that `strcpy()` is renamed to `__real_strcpy()`.

Most of the interceptors are actually redundant with static linking (since everything is instrumented anyway), but not all of them:
for example, functions written in pure assembly still need to be intercepted. For simplicity, we keep all interceptors that were
originally present in the AddressSanitizer runtime.

### Circular dependencies at compile-time

The AddressSanitizer runtime is built uninstrumented (for obvious reasons), and should technically depend on:
  1. `lib/musl`, for standard C functions, such as `getrlimit()`
  2. `lib/c++`, for stack unwinding
  3. both `lib/musl` and `lib/c++` for intercepted functions (see the section about interceptors above)

However, `lib/musl` and `lib/c++` depend back on the AddressSanitizer runtime, since they are instrumented,
and therefore need functions such as `__asan_report_load1()`. This introduces a circular dependency.

To resolve this, the AddressSanitizer runtime is built against the uninstrumented version of `lib/musl`, which provides
the headers for standard C functions (this solves 1). `clang` also has an internal version of `unwind.h` for stack unwinding,
which allows us to avoid depending on `lib/c++` (this solves 2). The intercepted functions are _declared_ in the
AddressSanitizer runtime itself (this solves 3).

The only remaining problem is that `lib/c++` (and also `lib/compiler_rt`) are built with CMake, which will try to link
a simple binary as part of the build process to check if the provided compiler is valid. This will not be possible,
because the binary is linked with the AddressSanitizer runtime, which contains references to functions residing in
`lib/c++`, which hasn't been built yet at that point. `lib/build/sanitize/hack_cmake` takes care of that.

### Circular dependencies at runtime

Instrumenting everything in `lib/musl` also introduces a circular dependency at runtime:
  * the instrumented TLS initialization code in `lib/musl` needs shadow memory to function propertly
  * however, the sanitizer runtime initialization code that sets the shadow memory up implicitly assumes that TLS has already been initialized

We solve this by instructing the compiler to avoid instrumenting all `lib/musl` initialization code that is run before `main()`.
